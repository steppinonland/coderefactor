This was our first homework assignment! I fixed this webpage so that when you click on a link, it opens up into a new page.

Then, I changed the HTML semantics to HTML5 notation. I organized the elements into header, sections, articles, asides, and a footer.

I also applied accessibility features, especially to the photos so that they're easy to process in screen readers etc.

I also moved the nav bar down, and rewrote some of the CSS style code.

Yay Horiseon!
